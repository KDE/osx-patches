This repository holds patches to fix problems in KDE 4.13 and earlier that occur
in an Apple OS X environment. Its directory structure follows that of central
KDE Projects and repositories, except that it is all one repository, contains
only patches and holds only those sub-directories for which patches exist.

There is also a subdirectory KDEMacPortsTools that holds tools for building and
testing KDE on Apple OS X, from source repositories using kdesrc-build. See the
README_FIRST file in that subdirectory for details.

CURRENT PATCH-BASE (as at 30 June 2014)

Basically this is branch KDE/4.13 for KDE 4 software that is still being
released (releases 4.13.x) and branch master for KDE 4 software that is
frozen (e.g. libraries where KDE development has moved to KF 5).
